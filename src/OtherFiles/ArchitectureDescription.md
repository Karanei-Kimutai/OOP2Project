Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture Explanation

The Drink Enterprise System, as developed, can be mapped to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, especially when considering its distributed nature.

1. Model
The Model is the heart of the application, responsible for managing the data, business logic, and rules. It's primarily located on the server-side.
Data Entities (POJOs - Plain Old Java Objects):

Drink.java, Branch.java, OrderItem.java, Order.java, User.java

These classes define the structure of the application's data. They are simple objects that hold data and are passed between different layers, including over RMI to the client.

StockItem.java is also a data-holding class, though primarily used internally within the server's service and DAO layers.

Business Logic (Service Layer):

AuthServiceImpl.java, DrinkServiceImpl.java, BranchServiceImpl.java, StockServiceImpl.java, OrderServiceImpl.java, ReportingServiceImpl.java

These classes (and their corresponding interfaces like IDrinkService) encapsulate the core business operations and rules. For example, OrderServiceImpl handles the logic for placing an order, which includes checking stock, calculating totals, and ensuring atomicity through transaction management.

They act as a facade, providing a clear API for the application's functionalities and coordinating actions between DAOs.

Data Access Layer (DAO):

Interfaces: IDrinkDAO, IBranchDAO, IStockItemDAO, IUserDAO, IOrderDAO

Implementations: DrinkDAOImpl, BranchDAOImpl, etc.

This layer is responsible for all direct interactions with the database (MySQL in this case). It abstracts the database operations (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete) from the service layer.

DatabaseManager.java is a utility class supporting this layer by managing database connections.

PasswordUtil.java is a utility used by AuthServiceImpl (via IUserDAO) for secure password handling, which is part of data management.

2. View
The View is responsible for presenting data to the user and for capturing user input. In this application, we have two distinct views, both residing on the client-side.

Graphical User Interface (GUI View):

MainFrame.java, LoginPanel.java, AppPanel.java (and its various sub-panels for viewing drinks, placing orders, admin functions, reports).

These Swing classes create the visual interface that the user interacts with (windows, buttons, tables, forms). They display data retrieved from the Model (via RMI calls) and send user actions to the Controller parts.

Command-Line Interface (CLI View):

CLIRunner.java and its methods that handle printing menus, prompts, and results to the console, as well as reading user input from the command line.

3. Controller
The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input from the View, interacts with the Model to perform actions or retrieve data, and then updates the View with the results.

Client-Side Controllers:

GUI Controllers (Implicit/Event-Driven):

The ActionListeners attached to Swing components (e.g., buttons in LoginPanel, AppPanel) act as controllers. When a user clicks a button, the actionPerformed method is triggered.

Inside these event handlers, SwingWorker instances are often used. The doInBackground() method of the SwingWorker makes calls to the RMI service interfaces (which are client-side proxies to the server-side Model).

The done() method of the SwingWorker (which runs on the Swing Event Dispatch Thread) then takes the results from the Model and updates the GUI View (e.g., populating a JTable, displaying a status message).

CLI Controller (Implicit):

The main loop and conditional logic within CLIRunner.java's run() method and its helper methods (e.g., handleLogin, placeOrderCLI) serve as the controller for the CLI. They parse user commands, invoke methods on the RMI service interfaces, and then format/print the results to the console (View).

Server-Side "Controllers" (RMI Service Entry Points):

The RMI Service Implementation classes (DrinkServiceImpl, OrderServiceImpl, etc.) on the server act as the primary entry points for requests coming from the client.

When a client-side controller invokes a method on an RMI service stub, the call is transmitted to the corresponding remote object on the server. This remote object (e.g., OrderServiceImpl) then orchestrates the necessary operations within the Model (calling other services or DAOs).

In this sense, these RMI services bridge the client's Controller actions to the server's Model execution.

How RMI Fits In
The RMI interfaces (IDrinkService, etc.) define the contract between the client (View/Controller) and the server (Model).

The client holds stubs (proxies) for these remote services.

When the client-side Controller needs to interact with the Model, it calls methods on these stubs. RMI handles the network communication to invoke the actual methods on the server-side service implementations.

Data (POJOs like Drink, Order) is serialized and passed between the client and server via RMI.

Summary Flow (Example: User places an order via GUI)
View (GUI - AppPanel's Place Order Tab): User fills in order details and clicks "Submit Order".

Controller (GUI - ActionListener & SwingWorker):

The ActionListener for the submit button is triggered.

It creates a SwingWorker.

SwingWorker.doInBackground(): Collects data from the GUI form fields and calls orderService.placeOrder(...) (the RMI stub).

RMI: The call is transmitted to the OrderServiceImpl on the server.

Model (Server - OrderServiceImpl):

Receives the request.

Performs business logic (validates data, checks stock via IStockService or directly with IStockItemDAO within a transaction).

Interacts with DAOs (IOrderDAO, IStockItemDAO) to persist changes to the database. This involves managing a transaction.

Returns the created Order object (or an exception).

RMI: The Order object (or exception) is serialized and sent back to the client.

Controller (GUI - SwingWorker.done()):

Receives the Order object (or handles the exception).

Updates the View (AppPanel) to display a confirmation message, clear the form, etc.

This separation of concerns makes the application more modular, easier to maintain, and allows for different views (CLI and GUI) to reuse the same underlying server-side Model and business logic.
