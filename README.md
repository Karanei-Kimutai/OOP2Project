Database credentials

Storing database credentials the way we were doing initially was really inefficient and caused lots of merge conflicts, we've resolved that now but here's a note
You need to create a file in the src directory and name it credentialsConfiguration.properties
Then, copy the contents in the file credentialsConfigurationTemplate.properties
Edit the placeholders to the credentials you're using on your pc
